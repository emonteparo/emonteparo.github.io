## Welcome to Esmeralda's ePortfolio!

The portfolio consists of three final projects, where each of them corresponds to a different portion of the project as a whole. The three portions of the portfolio, and their respective final projects, are as follows:

```markdown  
  1. Software Design & Engineering  /  CS 330 Room.cpp, Chair.cpp, Table.cpp
  2. Algorithms & Data Structure    /  CS 340 FinalProjectMonteparo.py, FinalProjectMonteparo2.py, FindAndAggregate.py
  3. Databases                      /  DAT 220 FinalProject_DATABASES_DODD.docx, FinalProjectData.jmp
```

Along with each of these final projects, there is a narrative that spells out the process of enhancing the original projects to meet the standards for the ePortfolio.

To view the first part of the project, please click this [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/YPDsReeT4vQ) which contains the CS 499 code review and beginning stages and plans for starting the enhancements.
